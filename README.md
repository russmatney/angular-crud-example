##Intent

This is a small angular app intended to show **one** method of organization
in an AngularJS app.
The use-case in particular is a set of CRUD operations against an endpoint.

Assuming the object is a Unicorn, the user-stories are roughly as follows:

> As a user, I want to see all of the Unicorns in the database.

> As a user, I want to see a detail view of a Unicorn.

> As a user, I want to create a new Unicorn.

> As a user, I want to edit and update a Unicorn.

> As a user, I want to delete a Unicorn.

AngularJS provides a number of tools for handling interactions with RESTful
APIs, and parallels to these stories show up in countless business-related apps.
